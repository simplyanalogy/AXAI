# AXAI
Analogical Explainable AI

We use analogical classifiers as surrogate model to provide counterfactual explanations.
- *Artificial datasets*: they are created with python code.
- *Real datasets*: unzip the file realDatasets.zip where there are all data we have tested.
- To get the FRI score, run *1-fri-computation.ipynb*.
- To get the explanation, please run *2-explanations.ipynb*.
- *utils* is the folder containing the diverse functions/methods that we use in the 2 main notebooks.
- the file *utils/test_functions_definition.py* contains the definition of the 5 functions we use in the paper. Any other functions should be added in this file.
- the *test* folder is used to save the artificial data when they are tested.
